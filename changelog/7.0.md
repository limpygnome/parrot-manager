Features:
- Import/export database - supports JSON and CSV.

Changes:
- Layout of backup files.
- Entries, when viewing node, ordered correctly.
- Nodes with blank names show as unnamed.

Fixes:
- Database was not syncing on save (when enabled).
- Minor null pointer fix when merging databases (when DB value changes to null).
- Merging database will only trigger single save, and thus backup.




- Option to delay backups on save, as to prevent lots of backups when making lots of small changes.



Features:
- Stand-alone JAR now available.
- Window location and size persisted to user preferences.
- Clipboard can be wiped after period of time, after copying password.

Changes:
- Database version marker, for future format changes
- Stand-alone versions will read user settings from working directory.
- Sync aborted if unsaved changes.
- Database format documented.

Fixes:
- URLs opened in browser must be hard-coded outside webapp (isolating UI).
- Lock-up when opening DB / suspected sync threading issue
- Need to check array of backups ref held in session, seen to disappear.
