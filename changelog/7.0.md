Features:
- Import/export database - supports JSON and CSV.
- Option to delay backups on save, as to prevent lots of backups when making lots of small changes.
- Clipboard can be wiped after period of time, after copying password.
- Window location and size persisted to user preferences.

Changes:
- Major UI redesign (side bar, settings, change log and more).
- Layout of backup files.
- Entries, when viewing node, ordered correctly.
- Nodes with blank names show as unnamed.
- URLs opened in browser must be hard-coded, isolating UI from being able to open malicious links.
- Settings performance improved (UI).

Fixes:
- Database was not syncing on save (when enabled).
- Minor null pointer fix when merging databases (when DB value changes to null).
- Merging database will only trigger single save, and thus backup.
- Remote sync sometimes locking UI when opening database.
- Mac keyboard layout not chosen automatically.
- Backups page sometimes going blank.
- Showing/hiding empty value would be detected as change.


- Stand-alone versions will read user settings from working directory.
- Stand-alone JAR now available.
- Support for Linux Snaps as distribution.
- Changelog UI improvements.

Serious bugs:
    - Cancelling sync results in empty database written to remote host.


Features:

Changes:
- Database version marker, for future format changes
- Sync aborted if unsaved changes.
- Database format documented.
- Closing database after inactivity moved out of front-end.

Fixes:
- Lock-up when opening DB / suspected sync threading issue
    - Seems to occur only on slow connections?
