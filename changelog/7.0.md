Features:
- Import/export database - supports JSON and CSV.
- Option to delay backups on save, as to prevent lots of backups when making lots of small changes.
- Clipboard can be wiped after period of time, after copying password.

Changes:
- Layout of backup files.
- Entries, when viewing node, ordered correctly.
- Nodes with blank names show as unnamed.

Fixes:

- Merging database will only trigger single save, and thus backup.

Fixes:
