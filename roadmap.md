# Roadmap

## Now
- Persist window size to local user file
- Logout after period of inactivity
- When viewing backup, have toolbar or large button to restore permanently.
- Setting to wipe clipboard within time period, after copying an entry.
  - Option to be toggled in settings

## Next
- Persist random generator settings to local user file
- Backups on remote host when syncing
- Save-as
- Import/export
  - Allow entire database to be exported in JSON or other compatible formats
  - Should be fairly easy for JSON and will be a gateway to other formats.

## Later
- Move from `es5` to `es6`
- Compress final build's artifacts (minification)
- Add gzip compression to database file
