# parrot manager
The front-end application, using JavaFX with injected POJOs accessible as JavaScript objects. This is mainly
powered by the `parrot-library` module, acting as a shell for non-core / UI features and functionality.

At present the front-end uses AngularJS 2, which can be found under `src/main/resources/webapp`.
