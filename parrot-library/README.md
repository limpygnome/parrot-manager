# parrot library
This module contains most of the core functionality of parrot, which is an API for a password database.

Classes should use basic design patterns and not rely on dependency injection, with a high level of scrutiny in
unit testing.

It should be possible to re-use this library, with the current intention to keep the front-end entirely separate and
disposable.
